                        The system is designed to streamline the student admission process for a college. The system allows incoming students to pre-register online, receive an exam schedule automatically, and get notified through email.
                        <br>
                        The project was built using ReactJS for the frontend, providing an interactive interface, and PHP with MySQL for the backend to handle data storage and server-side operations. To visualize registration statistics, I integrated React Chart, which dynamically displays data through an intuitive pie chart.
                        <br>
                        For automated communication, I implemented EmailJS, enabling the system to send confirmation and exam schedule emails to examinees immediately after successful registration. Image uploads of payments are securely stored using Cloudinary, ensuring efficient cloud-based image management.
                        <br>
                        This project demonstrates a full-stack implementation that combines automation, data visualization, and user-friendly design to simplify college pre-registration and entrance examination scheduling workflows.
